<h1>Showtime Komputeishon</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>On some local forum there was a series of discussions about pure-graphical
program representations. It was going on and on. It was about how great it would
be, and how text representations are bad because the (anonymous) person that
started the discussions had a bad time learning any conventional text-based
languages.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle, when I tried to poke around, I wrote about somewhat
extreme version. Imagine multiple blocks connected by wires. There is a hidden
clock that drives blocks, makes them to perform calculations, or to just
propagate values through. Similar to digital logic components.</p>
<p>At the time the idea was just stupid. But when I read it again about a week
later, it changed from just stupid to stupid and fun.</p>

<h2>The thing</h2>
<p>Some code, and there you have it. Jumping blocks. Why not?</p>

<p>Some more code, and the arithmetic addition works.</p>

<p>As you see from the timestamps, I wasn't very quick. It took some time.
Meanwhile I was asked when a new video will come. And that's why the trailer was
born.</p>

<p>Around that time I decided that I was going to draw a circle with that thing.
A circle rasterization it not a very complicated algorithm, but it's not
trivial. There should be some decision logic, which can be tricky. Especially
if one needs to match the clock.</p>
<p>Visuals didn't change so much, but there were still quite a few additions.
A graph node with point converters was introduced. Node freezing became
a thing. So it became possible to freeze counters, reset their values, and then
to start again, without disconnecting wires.</p>

<p>And finally, a circle was rasterized. The scheme was smaller than I initially
expected it to be, since I was thinking about avoiding multiplications if
possible. But then there is no way to make a multiplication node to not multiply
numbers each cycle. That's how they are: they do their calculation each
time the clock ticks. And since there must be at least some of them anyway, why
not to use them more?</p>
<p>On the other hand, the interconnections are messy. They are even harder to
track than I imagined in my head. I can't say it's impossible to figure out
what the scheme does and how. But will anybody do that for real?</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I was thinking how hard would it be to code for such programming environment,
and how hard it would be to read others code. Circle rasterization was the code
I hoped I still can do, although with struggle. Suprisingly, it turned out that
predictions were correct. It's almost painful to watch that, if you imagine for
a second that you need to figure out how <i>that</i> works.
</p>
<p>Next time somebody tells me that graphical coding is easier, I'll have
something to show them.</p>
